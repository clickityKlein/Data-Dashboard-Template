# Data Dashboard Template
This template lays the foundation for creating a dashboard that can be uploaded
to a webpage using basic HTML, Flask, Plotly, and Bootstrap.

Discussed below (in this README), are the basics of this template and 
the process for uploading the webpage to a server. In this case,
the webpage was uploaded through a heroku server.

This was designed following a Udacity course project, but was completed outside
the Udacity environment. Both upload pathways will be detailed.
