# Data Dashboard Template
This template lays the foundation for creating a dashboard that can be uploaded
to a webpage using basic HTML, Flask, Plotly, and Bootstrap.

Discussed below (in this README), are the basics of this template and 
the process for uploading the webpage to a server. In this case,
the webpage was uploaded through a heroku server.

This was designed following a Udacity course project, but was completed outside
the Udacity environment. Both upload pathways will be detailed.

## Libraries Used
Note that once the app is ready to be uploaded, a requirements.txt file will be 
created. This file will be created in a virtual environment, trying to follow
the practice of only containing the essentials. However, the following libraries
are paramount to this template construction prior to a server upload.

Flask
Numpy
Pandas
Plotly

Additionally, the HTML file calls in a Bootstrap template. The Bootsrap website
features many templates which provide a front-end framework, essentially 
eliminating the need for CSS or Javascript.

## Project Motivation
The initial objective was to practice creating a dashboard and uploading the
dashboard to a server where others could reach it like any other website.

However, the initial task supplied the following two opportunities:
1. Create a dashboard template that is quick to duplicate for multiple uses.
2. Create a detailed account of template creation and the upload process.

For the second point above, both the initial template creation and the upload
process came with their share of troubleshooting. Documenting the entire
troubleshooting process and sharing what was found will help not only recreate
this exact webpage, but hopefully other users finding the same issues.
